# Casino Ride the Bus

A statistical gambling game with optimal strategy recommendations. Win up to 64x your bet across 4 challenging rounds!

## 🎰 Game Overview

Casino Ride the Bus is a 4-round betting game where you guess card attributes. Each correct guess multiplies your winnings, but one wrong guess loses everything. The key is knowing when to cash out!

### Game Rules

1. **Round 1**: Red or Black? (2x multiplier)
2. **Round 2**: Higher or Lower than first card? (2x multiplier) 
3. **Round 3**: Inside or Outside the range of first two cards? (3x multiplier)
4. **Round 4**: Pick the suit (must not be on board)? (4x multiplier)

**Maximum Payout**: 64x your original bet (2×2×3×4 = 48x profit + original bet)

## 🧠 Optimal Strategy

The game includes a built-in strategy advisor based on statistical analysis:

### Round 1 Strategy
- Pick either color consistently (50/50 odds)

### Round 2 Strategy  
- **Cards 2-5**: Pick HIGHER (good odds)
- **Cards 6-10**: CASH OUT (danger zone - poor odds)
- **Cards J-A**: Pick LOWER (good odds)

### Round 3 Strategy
- **Pair/Connected cards**: Pick OUTSIDE (very high chance)
- **1-2 card gap**: Pick OUTSIDE (high chance)
- **3-8 card gap**: CASH OUT (danger zone)
- **9+ card gap**: Pick INSIDE (good odds due to large range)

### Round 4 Strategy
- Pick any suit NOT shown in the first 3 cards
- If all suits are used, you should have cashed out earlier!
