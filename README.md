# Ride the Bus - Flask PWA

A faithful implementation of the classic drinking card game "Ride the Bus" built as a Progressive Web App using Flask and Python.

## 🎯 Features

### Core Gameplay
- **Complete Rule Implementation**: All three phases (Deal, Pyramid, Bus) with exact rule enforcement
- **Seeded RNG**: Reproducible games using deterministic random number generation
- **2-10 Players**: Support for local pass-and-play and online multiplayer rooms
- **Configurable Settings**: Alcohol/points mode, customizable penalties and rewards

### Technical Features
- **Progressive Web App**: Installable, offline-capable web application
- **Real-time Multiplayer**: WebSocket-based rooms for online play
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, colorblind-friendly design
- **Cross-platform**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage of game rules and edge cases

## 🃏 Game Rules

### Phase 1: The Deal (R1-R4)
Each player gets 4 cards through a series of guesses:

- **R1 - Red or Black?**: Guess the color of your first card
- **R2 - Higher or Lower?**: Compare second card to first (Ace high)
- **R3 - Inside or Outside?**: Third card relative to first two card range
- **R4 - Pick a Suit**: Guess the suit of your fourth card

Wrong guesses result in drinking penalties. Equal cards in R2/R3 trigger reshuffling.

### Phase 2: The Pyramid
Cards arranged in a 5-4-3-2-1 pyramid. Players can match revealed cards with cards from their hand to assign drinks equal to the row value (1-5 drinks).

### Phase 3: Ride the Bus
Player with most remaining cards "rides the bus." Face cards and Aces in a 10-card sequence give drinks to the rider:
- Jack = 1 drink
- Queen = 2 drinks  
- King = 3 drinks
- Ace = 4 drinks

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Modern web browser

### Installation

1. **Clone and setup**:
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd ride-the-bus-flask
python -m venv venv
```

2. **Activate virtual environment**:
```bash
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install flask flask-socketio
```

4. **Run the application**:
```bash
python app.py
```

5. **Open in browser**:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

## 🎮 How to Play

### Local Game (Pass-and-Play)
1. Visit the landing page
2. Click "Start Local Game"
3. Add player names in the lobby
4. Host clicks "Start Game"
5. Pass device between players for their turns

### Online Multiplayer
1. Host creates a room and shares the room code
2. Players join using the room code
3. Host starts the game when all players are ready
4. Each player uses their own device

### Game Configuration
- **Alcohol Mode**: Toggle between drinking (sips) and family-friendly (points) mode
- **Game Seed**: Enter a number for reproducible games
- **House Rules**: Enable/disable multiple matches per pyramid flip

```

### Testing

Run the test suite to verify game rules:
```bash
python tests/test_engine.py
```

The tests cover all acceptance criteria from the specification:
- ✅ R1 color guess mechanics
- ✅ R2 higher/lower with reshuffle rule
- ✅ R3 inside/outside logic
- ✅ R4 suit guessing and rewards
- ✅ Pyramid matching and drink assignment
- ✅ Bus rider tie-breaking by highest card
- ✅ Bus phase face card scoring
- ✅ Seeded RNG reproducibility

### Game Engine API

The core game engine (`game/engine.py`) provides:

```python
# Create a new game
engine = GameEngine(seed=12345)
game = engine.create_game(['Alice', 'Bob'], seed=12345)

# Execute rounds in Phase 1
card, correct, penalty = engine.execute_round(game, Guess.RED)
engine.advance_to_next_turn(game)

# Start Phase 2 (Pyramid)
engine.start_phase_two(game)
flipped_card = engine.flip_next_pyramid_card(game)
drinks = engine.commit_match(game, player_id, matching_card)

# Start Phase 3 (Bus)
engine.start_phase_three(game)
card, drinks = engine.flip_next_bus_card(game)
```

### Seeded Reproducibility

Games can be reproduced exactly using the same seed:

```python
# Both games will have identical card sequences
game1 = GameEngine(seed=42).create_game(['Alice', 'Bob'], seed=42)
game2 = GameEngine(seed=42).create_game(['Alice', 'Bob'], seed=42)
```

## 🌐 API Reference

### HTTP Endpoints

## ♿ Accessibility Features

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full game playable with keyboard only
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML

- **Push Notifications**: Turn notifications for online games

## 🔧 Configuration

The game behavior can be customized through the `Config` class in `game/types.py`:

```python
config = Config()
config.penalty["sips_wrong_guess_r1"] = 2  # Increase R1 penalty
config.reward["reward_distribute_drinks"] = 3  # Reduce R4 reward
config.alcohol_mode["enabled"] = False  # Start in points mode
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

- R4 suit selection is simplified (color-based rather than exact suit)
- Local games require manual device passing
- Real-time sync may lag on slow connections
- PWA installation prompts vary by browser
